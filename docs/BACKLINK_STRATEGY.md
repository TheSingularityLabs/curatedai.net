# Backlink Strategy for AI Tool Directory

## 🎯 WHY BACKLINKS MATTER

**For "ai tool directory" ranking:**
- Domain Authority (DA) is critical
- Backlinks = trust signals to Google
- Quality > Quantity (10 quality links > 100 spam links)
- Natural link building = sustainable growth

**Current Status:**
- New domain = low authority
- Need 50-100 quality backlinks for competitive keywords
- Focus on relevant, high-DA sites
