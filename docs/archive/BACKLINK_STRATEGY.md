# Backlink Building Strategy

## Why Backlinks Matter

Backlinks (external sites linking to you) are crucial for SEO authority. Google sees them as "votes of confidence" - the more quality sites link to you, the higher you rank.

## 🎯 Strategy 1: Tool Creator Outreach (Highest ROI)

### What to Do
Reach out to the AI tool creators whose tools you've curated.

### Email Template
```
Subject: Featured your tool on our curated AI directory

Hi [Tool Name] team,

I run a curated AI tool directory (aitools.thesingularitylabs.xyz) and we've featured [Tool Name] in our directory.

We hand-pick tools and write detailed descriptions - not just a link dump. Your tool is listed here:
[Link to your tool page]

Would you consider:
1. Adding a link to our directory on your "Resources" or "Press" page?
2. Sharing our directory on social media?

Happy to provide any additional info or answer questions.

Thanks!
[Your name]
```
